# Mobile Tab Navigation

If deployed: https://thedanitor.github.io/mobile_tab_navigation/

This project is from the Day 38 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Today's project was creating a mobile navigation menu. This was done using four images and four menu items. When a menu item is clicked on, the corresponding image appears by removing and adding classes ("active" class for the menu item and "show" class for the image). I was able to come up with most of the JavaScript myself. The trick with this was to add the "show" class to the image with the same index as the menu item. Much easier than a switch or if/else if statement.
